To run my visualisation the user will need to run my code and go through the menu and chose option 3, which is the "Death Rate Graph". By selecting this option the user will be prompted to input a country they wish to see the relevant information on. Once this country has been input, the graph will load with the appropriate axis numbers aswell as a visualisation of the death rate over the past coule years

-Charlie
After you are brought to my section from the main menu, you will be asked which country you would like to see data for. You must enter the country in the correct format, which is with a capital letter and spelt correctly. After you enter this specific country the data set for this country will be displayed and then the graph will be plotted and displayed for you in a line graph form with the dates on the x-axis, and cases and deaths on the y-axis.
