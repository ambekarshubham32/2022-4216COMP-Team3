To run my visualisation the user will need to run my code and go through the menu and chose option 3, which is the "Death Rate Graph". By selecting this option the user will be prompted to input a country they wish to see the relevant information on. Once this country has been input, the graph will load with the appropriate axis numbers aswell as a visualisation of the death rate over the past coule years

-Charlie
After you are brought to my section from the main menu, you will be asked which country you would like to see data for. You must enter the country in the correct format, which is with a capital letter and spelt correctly. After you enter this specific country the data set for this country will be displayed and then the graph will be plotted and displayed for you in a line graph form with the dates on the x-axis, and cases and deaths on the y-axis.

On the y axis, you will see the number of countries which use the different vaccines mentioned. On the x axis, you will see the different vaccines used accross the globe.

Once you are redirected to my section of the programme, the user will be greeted with a message that asks you to input the name of a country. Doing so will print the total number of vaccines for this country. Next, the user will be asked to input a second country’s name to compare data with. This data will be printed and a bar chart will be produced, demonstrating a visual of the total number of vaccinations in both countries.
