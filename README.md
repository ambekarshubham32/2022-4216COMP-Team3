To run my visualisation the user will need to run my code and go through the menu and chose option 3, which is the "Death Rate Graph". By selecting this option the user will be prompted to input a country they wish to see the relevant information on. Once this country has been input, the graph will load with the appropriate axis numbers aswell as a visualisation of the death rate over the past coule years
